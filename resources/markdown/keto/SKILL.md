# Ketogenic Diet (Strict)

**Clinical Focus:** Extremely low carbohydrate (<20g), very high fat.  
**Macro Targets:** Carbs 5% | Protein 20% | Fat 75%

## Core Principles

- Induce nutritional ketosis by depleting liver glycogen
- Strict precision required — exceeding 5% carbs halts ketosis
- Moderate protein to prevent gluconeogenesis
- Fat becomes primary fuel source (ketones)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Carbohydrate Restriction

```
Net Carbs: <20g per day (total carbs - fiber)
Allowed: Leafy greens, cauliflower, zucchini, avocado
Avoid: All grains, legumes, most fruits, starchy vegetables
Track: Every gram matters — use a tracking app
```

### Fat Loading

```
Sources: MCT oil, coconut oil, butter, ghee, avocados
Fatty meats: Bacon, ribeye, salmon, sardines
Nuts/seeds: Macadamia, pecans, walnuts (portion controlled)
Oils: Olive oil, avocado oil liberally
```

### Protein Moderation

```
Target: 20% of calories (moderate, not high)
Reason: Excess protein converts to glucose (gluconeogenesis)
Calculation: ~0.8-1.0g per kg lean body mass
Sources: Fatty cuts preferred over lean
```

### Electrolyte Protocol (Critical)

```
Sodium: 3-5g daily (bone broth, salted foods)
Magnesium: 300-500mg supplement
Potassium: 2-4g from food or supplement
Water: 2-3L minimum daily
Note: Prevents "Keto Flu" — non-negotiable
```

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Ketone levels:** Blood ketones 0.5-3.0 mmol/L (nutritional ketosis)
- **Net carbs:** Strict <20g daily
- **Protein:** Monitor to avoid gluconeogenesis
- **Electrolytes:** Sodium, magnesium, potassium

## When to Use

- Epilepsy management (especially pediatric)
- Strict diabetes control under supervision
- Metabolic syndrome intervention
- Short-term weight loss acceleration
- Cognitive enhancement (some cases)

## Clinical Notes

- **Diabetic Friendly:** Yes — BUT requires medical supervision for insulin users
- **Hypoglycemia Risk:** High for those on insulin or sulfonylureas
- **Not for Everyone:** Contraindicated in pancreatitis, liver disease, porphyria
- **Long-term:** Debated safety beyond 6-12 months without monitoring
