# Vegetarian Diet

**Clinical Focus:** No meat/poultry/fish. Eggs and dairy allowed.  
**Macro Targets:** Carbs 55% | Protein 15% | Fat 30%

## Core Principles

- Lacto-ovo approach: includes dairy and eggs
- Source complete proteins from non-flesh foods
- Maintain iron and B12 levels through eggs/dairy
- Balance higher carb load with fiber and protein diversity

## Implementation Guidelines

### Protein Sources

```
Complete Proteins:
  - Eggs (all amino acids)
  - Dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese)
  - Soy (tofu, tempeh, edamame)
  - Quinoa, buckwheat

Complementary Proteins (combine daily):
  - Legumes + grains (beans + rice)
  - Nuts/seeds + legumes
  - Dairy + grains
```

### Iron Strategy

```
Plant Sources: Spinach, lentils, fortified cereals, pumpkin seeds
Absorption Tip: Pair with Vitamin C (citrus, peppers, tomatoes)
Avoid: Coffee/tea with iron-rich meals (inhibits absorption)
Monitor: Ferritin levels annually
```

### B12 Sources

```
Primary: Eggs, dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt)
Fortified: Plant milks, breakfast cereals, nutritional yeast
Note: Generally sufficient with lacto-ovo approach
```

### Meal Structure Example

```
Breakfast: Greek yogurt + berries + nuts + honey
Lunch: Chickpea curry + brown rice + spinach salad
Dinner: Vegetable frittata + roasted sweet potatoes
Snacks: Hard-boiled eggs, cheese, hummus + veggies
```

## Key Nutrients to Monitor

- **Iron:** Absorption enhanced with Vitamin C
- **B12:** Adequate via eggs and dairy
- **Zinc:** Found in dairy, eggs, legumes, seeds
- **Omega-3:** ALA from flax, chia; consider algae supplement

## When to Use

- Ethical/animal welfare considerations
- Environmental sustainability goals
- Reduced cancer risk (some evidence)
- Lower saturated fat intake
- Flexible plant-based approach

## Clinical Notes

- **Diabetic Friendly:** Yes — if refined carbs limited
- **Protein Quality:** Eggs and dairy provide complete proteins
- **Iron Status:** Monitor ferritin, especially for menstruating women
- **Advantage:** More flexible than vegan with better nutrient profile
