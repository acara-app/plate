# DASH Diet

**Clinical Focus:** Low sodium, high potassium, rich in fruits and vegetables.  
**Macro Targets:** Carbs 52% | Protein 18% | Fat 30%

## Core Principles

- Mechanically designed to lower blood pressure through micronutrient balance
- Restrict sodium while increasing potassium, magnesium, and calcium
- Emphasize whole foods over processed options
- Balance macronutrients for heart health

## Implementation Guidelines

### Sodium Restrictions

```
Standard DASH: <2,300mg sodium per day
Therapeutic DASH: <1,500mg sodium per day
Avoid: Processed foods, canned soups, deli meats, restaurant meals
Read labels: Look for "low sodium" or "no salt added"
Seasoning: Use herbs, spices, lemon, vinegar instead of salt
```

### Potassium Boost

```

## Key Nutrients to Emphasize

- **Magnesium:** 500mg daily (relaxes blood vessels)
- **Calcium:** 1,200mg daily (vascular health)
- **Fiber:** 30g+ daily (cardiovascular protection)

## When to Use

- Hypertension management (primary use)
- Prehypertension prevention
- Cardiovascular disease prevention
- Stroke risk reduction
- Diabetes management (diabetic friendly)

## Clinical Notes

- **Diabetic Friendly:** Yes — excellent for diabetes + hypertension combo
- **Blood Pressure:** Can lower BP by 8-14 points within weeks
- **Heart Health:** Premier choice for cardiovascular disease prevention
- **Caution:** Those with kidney disease may need potassium restriction
