# Low Carb Diet (Diabetic Friendly)

**Clinical Focus:** Reduced carbohydrates (<130g), increased protein and fats.  
**Macro Targets:** Carbs 20% | Protein 35% | Fat 45%

## Core Principles

- Cap carbohydrates at 20% of total caloric intake
- Focus on minimizing glycemic excursions without inducing ketosis
- Prioritize high-fiber, low-glycemic carb sources
- Increase protein for satiety and muscle preservation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Carbohydrate Sources

```
Allowed: Leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, berries
Limited: Root vegetables, legumes, whole grains
Avoid: Refined sugars, white flour, processed carbs
Daily Max: <130g total carbohydrates
```

### Protein Strategy

```
Target: 35% of calories
Sources: Lean meats, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt
Timing: Distribute evenly across meals
Purpose: Preserve lean muscle mass during weight loss
```

### Meal Structure Example

```
Breakfast: Eggs + avocado + spinach
Lunch: Grilled chicken + large salad + olive oil
Dinner: Salmon + roasted broccoli + butter
Snacks: Nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs
```

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Total carbs:** Keep under 130g/day
- **Net carbs:** Focus on high-fiber sources (net = total - fiber)
- **Protein intake:** Aim for 35% of calories
- **Blood glucose:** Monitor for improved stability

## When to Use

- Type 2 diabetes management
- Prediabetes intervention
- Weight loss with metabolic support
- Transitioning to ketogenic diet
- Breaking carbohydrate dependency

## Clinical Notes

- **Diabetic Friendly:** Yes — highly effective for glucose management
- **Ketosis:** Does NOT induce ketosis (unlike keto diet)
- **Fiber Focus:** Critical to choose fiber-rich carb sources
- **Hydration:** Increase water intake to support metabolic changes
