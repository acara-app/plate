# Vegan Diet

**Clinical Focus:** Strictly plant-based. No animal products.  
**Macro Targets:** Carbs 60% | Protein 14% | Fat 26%

## Core Principles

- Strict exclusion of all animal products (meat, dairy, eggs, honey)
- Higher natural carbohydrate load (60%) from legumes/grains
- Critical attention to supplementation (B12 mandatory)
- Protein density and combining strategies required

## Implementation Guidelines

### Protein Strategy

```
High-Protein Plants:
  - Seitan (75g protein per cup)
  - Tempeh (31g per cup)
  - Lentils (18g per cup)
  - Tofu (20g per cup)
  - Edamame (17g per cup)

Daily Variety Required:
  - Rotate legumes, grains, nuts, seeds
  - Aim for protein at every meal
  - Consider protein powder if needed
```

### Mandatory Supplementation

```
B12 (CRITICAL):
  - Cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamin
  - 250-500mcg daily OR 2,000mcg weekly
  - No plant sources exist

Recommended:
  - Algae-based Omega-3 (DHA/EPA)
  - Vitamin D3 (vegan source)
  - Iron (if ferritin low)
  - Zinc
```

### Protein Combining

```
Daily Variety (not per-meal required):
  - Legumes + grains (rice + beans)
  - Nuts/seeds + legumes (hummus)
  - Grains + nuts/seeds (oatmeal + almond butter)

Goal: Complete amino acid profile across the day
```

### Volume Eating

```
Reality: Lower caloric density requires larger portions
Strategy:
  - Large salads with calorie-dense toppings
  - Smoothies with nut butters, protein powder
  - Legumes and grains as meal foundation
  - Avocados, nuts, seeds for healthy fats
```

## Key Nutrients to Monitor

- **B12:** Mandatory supplementation
- **Iron:** Pair with Vitamin C; monitor ferritin
- **Omega-3:** Algae-based DHA/EPA recommended
- **Calcium:** Fortified plant milks, tofu, leafy greens
- **Zinc:** Legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains
- **Vitamin D:** Supplement recommended, especially winter

## When to Use

- Ethical veganism (animal rights)
- Environmental impact reduction
- Potential cardiovascular benefits
- Lower cancer risk (some evidence)
- Digestive health (high fiber)

## Clinical Notes

- **Diabetic Friendly:** Not automatically — 60% carb load requires monitoring
- **WFPB Version:** Whole Food Plant Based can be excellent for diabetes
- **B12 Critical:** Deficiency causes irreversible nerve damage
- **Protein:** Requires more planning than omnivore diets
