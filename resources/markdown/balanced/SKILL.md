# Standard Balanced Diet (USDA)

**Clinical Focus:** Moderate mix of all macronutrients per dietary guidelines.  
**Macro Targets:** Carbs 50% | Protein 20% | Fat 30%

## Core Principles

- Follows "MyPlate" and Dietary Guidelines for Americans
- Most flexible and sustainable approach for general population
- Focus on variety, portion control, and nutrient density
- No food groups eliminated — moderation over restriction

## Implementation Guidelines

### The MyPlate Method

```
50% Plate: Fruits and vegetables (variety of colors)
25% Plate: Grains (prefer whole grains)
25% Plate: Protein (mix of animal and plant sources)
Beverage: Water as primary drink
Dairy: 2-3 servings low-fat dairy daily (separate side)
```

### Macronutrient Balance

```
Carbohydrates 50%:
  - Emphasize whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats)
  - Include fruits and starchy vegetables
  - Limit refined grains and added sugars (<10% calories)

Protein 20%:
  - Mix of lean meats, poultry, fish
  - Legumes, nuts, seeds
  - Eggs and dairy
  - Distribute throughout the day

Fat 30%:
  - Prioritize unsaturated fats (olive oil, nuts, avocados)
  - Limit saturated fat (<10% calories)
  - Avoid trans fats completely
```

### Portion Guidelines

```
Grains: 1 slice bread = 1 oz equivalent; aim for 5-8 oz daily
Protein: Deck of cards = 3 oz meat; aim for 5-6.5 oz daily
Vegetables: 1 cup raw or 1/2 cup cooked = 1 serving; aim for 2.5-3 cups
Fruits: 1 medium fruit or 1/2 cup = 1 serving; aim for 1.5-2 cups
Dairy: 1 cup milk or yogurt = 1 serving; aim for 3 cups
```

### Hydration and Limits

```
Water: Primary beverage; 8+ cups daily
Added Sugars: <10% of total calories (200 cal on 2,000 cal diet)
Saturated Fat: <10% of total calories
Sodium: <2,300mg daily
Alcohol: Moderation if consumed (1 drink women, 2 men daily max)
```

## Key Nutrients Across Food Groups

- **Fiber:** Whole grains, fruits, vegetables (25-35g daily)
- **Calcium:** Dairy, fortified plant milks, leafy greens
- **Vitamin D:** Fatty fish, fortified foods, sunlight
- **B12:** Meat, fish, dairy, eggs
- **Iron:** Red meat, beans, fortified cereals + Vitamin C

## When to Use

- General population nutrition education
- Long-term sustainable eating patterns
- No medical dietary restrictions needed
- Teaching children healthy eating habits
- Transitioning from restrictive diets
- Weight maintenance (not aggressive loss)

## Clinical Notes

- **Diabetic Friendly:** Yes — promotes predictable macronutrient distribution
- **Sustainability:** Most sustainable long-term approach
- **Flexibility:** Accommodates cultural and personal preferences
- **Evidence-Based:** Based on decades of nutritional research
- **Maintenance:** Ideal for weight maintenance after loss
