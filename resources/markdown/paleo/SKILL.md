# Paleo Diet

**Clinical Focus:** Ancestral eating. No grains, legumes, or dairy.  
**Macro Targets:** Carbs 30% | Protein 35% | Fat 35%

## Core Principles

- Eliminate Neolithic foods (grains, legumes, dairy) to reduce inflammation
- Focus on foods available to Paleolithic ancestors
- Naturally lower carb than standard diet, higher protein than Keto
- Emphasize food quality (grass-fed, wild-caught, organic)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Elimination List (Strict)

```
Grains: Wheat, rice, corn, oats, quinoa, all gluten and gluten-free
Legumes: Beans, lentils, peanuts, soy (all forms)
Dairy: Milk, cheese, yogurt, butter (ghee allowed)
Processed Foods: Anything with additives, preservatives
Refined Sugar: White sugar, high-fructose corn syrup
Vegetable Oils: Canola, soybean, corn oil
```

### Allowed Foods

```
Proteins: Grass-fed beef, wild-caught fish, pastured poultry, eggs
Vegetables: All non-starchy vegetables liberally
Fruits: Berries, apples, citrus (moderate portions)
Fats: Coconut oil, olive oil, avocado oil, animal fats
Nuts/Seeds: Almonds, walnuts, macadamia (not peanuts)
Starches: Sweet potatoes, squash, yams, plantains
Sweeteners: Raw honey, maple syrup (sparingly)
```

### Carbohydrate Sources

```
Primary: Sweet potatoes, butternut squash, yams
Secondary: Fruits (berries, apples, bananas)
Occasional: Raw honey, maple syrup
Avoid: All grains and legumes
Target: 30% of calories from these sources
```

### Quality Standards

```
Meat: Grass-fed, pasture-raised when possible
Fish: Wild-caught over farmed
Eggs: Pastured/free-range
Produce: Organic for "Dirty Dozen" items
Fats: Cold-pressed, unrefined oils
```

## Key Nutrients to Monitor

- **Calcium:** Without dairy, get from leafy greens, bone-in fish
- **Fiber:** Lower without grains/legumes — emphasize vegetables
- **Carb Intake:** Can drift high with fruit/honey if not monitored
- **B12:** Adequate from animal proteins

## When to Use

- Autoimmune condition management
- Identifying food sensitivities (elimination diet)
- Reducing systemic inflammation
- Whole-foods-based eating approach
- Breaking sugar/processed food addictions

## Clinical Notes

- **Diabetic Friendly:** Not automatically flagged — restricts legumes (blood sugar stabilizers)
- **Inflammation:** Can reduce markers like CRP for some individuals
- **Sustainability:** Expensive and environmentally demanding (high meat)
- **Long-term:** Difficult to maintain; often used as 30-90 day reset
- **Legume Restriction:** Removes fiber-rich, diabetes-friendly foods
