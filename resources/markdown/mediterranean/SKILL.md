# Mediterranean Diet (Gold Standard)

**Clinical Focus:** High healthy fats (olive oil), fiber, lean proteins. Low red meat.  
**Macro Targets:** Carbs 45% | Protein 18% | Fat 37%

## Core Principles

- Prioritize Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs) from extra virgin olive oil and nuts
- Emphasize whole grains, legumes, fish, and vegetables
- Minimize processed foods and red meat

## Implementation Guidelines

### Fat Sources

```
Primary: Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)
Secondary: Nuts, seeds, avocados
Avoid: Butter, margarine, trans fats
```

### Protein Rotation

```
Fish: Minimum 2x per week (salmon, sardines, mackerel)
Legumes: Daily (chickpeas, lentils, beans)
Poultry: Moderate (2-3x per week)
Red Meat: Rare occasions (monthly max)
```

### Plate Composition

```
50% Non-starchy vegetables (leafy greens, tomatoes, peppers)
25% Whole grains (quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat)
25% Lean protein (fish, legumes, poultry)
Drizzle: EVOO liberally
```

## Key Nutrients to Emphasize

- **Omega-3 fatty acids** (fatty fish, walnuts)
- **Fiber** (vegetables, legumes, whole grains)
- **Polyphenols** (olive oil, red wine in moderation, berries)
- **Antioxidants** (colorful vegetables, herbs)

## When to Use

- Cardiovascular health optimization
- Longevity-focused nutrition plans
- Diabetes management (diabetic friendly)
- Inflammatory condition support
- General health maintenance

## Clinical Notes
